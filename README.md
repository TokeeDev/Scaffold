# 🏗️ Scaffold

**Your vibe planner for vibe coding.**  
Plan like a product manager. Build like a senior engineer.

## ✨ Overview

**Scaffold** is your AI-powered planning OS for software projects. It helps you think through your idea, structure your architecture, and execute with clarity — before you ever touch your codebase.

It’s for solo devs, indie hackers, and small teams who want the power of deep planning without killing their flow. Think: product manager, system architect, and AI prompt engineer — all in one.

## 🔥 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI Discovery Flow**  
  Answer high-quality planning questions — WHAT, WHO, WHY, HOW — and get a fully structured build plan.

- ✅ **Smart Task Boards**  
  Auto-generated, editable tasks with subtasks, context, and step-by-step instructions.

- 🧱 **Prompt Engineering Hub**  
  Create per-file or per-feature prompt rules for Cursor. Export full `.cursor-config.json`.

- 🗂️ **Project Hub**  
  Store your README, feature breakdowns, architecture notes, and planning artifacts.

- 🎨 **Asset Locker**  
  Upload and organize your logo, color palette, UI inspiration, and naming notes.
